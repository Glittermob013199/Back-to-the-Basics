# Back-to-the-Basics
Just a way for me to flex my HTML muscles and start to review.

		<title>All about me!</title>

	<body style="background-color: blue">
	    <h1>Morgan Emily Byers</h1>
	        <p>My name is Morgan. I was born January 31st. I play violin and love to learn new things. I am very short and can sometimes be shy, but when I'm with my friends I love to be loud and in the spotlight.</p>
	   <h2>My plans for the <em>dun dun dunn... </em> FUTURE</h2>
	    <p style="font-size: 14px">I want to study biomedical engineering at California Polytechnic Institute in San Luis, Obispo. I hope to find a way to mix computers with biology in order to improve people's lives. I will definitely always continue to follow my passion for music as well by always playing my violin.</p>
